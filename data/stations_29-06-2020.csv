"466","Indian Institute of Petroleum(Dehradun)","Chemical","0","Dehradun","A1,","PROJECT-1: The cost of crude is the most critical factor in the refinery margin. This is the primary reason for the recent advancement in the refinery to use heavy or extra heavy crudes along with low-value refinery streams for petrochemicals. Light-coker Gasoil (LCGO) and heavy-coker gasoil is a VGO range material produced by the coker unit. Typically, the coker naphtha is sent to the hydrotreater and catalytic reformer, either by itself or with other similar naphthas. The light gasoil can go to the hydrocracker for secondary upgrading. Where the heavy-coker gasoil goes to the FCCU for secondary improvement. LCGO typically contains a certain amount of aromatics (e.g. 2.8-3.5 wt%) and can produce more valuable petrochemicals, and other chemical products. Therefore, in line with the rising appetite for petrochemical feedstock and a shift in product demand patterns will drive refiners to rethink their businesses on heavy feed to chemicals
PROJECT-2: 1. Effluent treatment study from the Bio-diesel plant. This will include the wastewater treatment. 2. Optimization, Kinetics and thermodynamic study on mobile unit based on Room temperature Bio-diesel process.
PROJECT-3: The production of ethylene and propylene from naphtha and gaseous feedstocks such as ethane, propane and other light naphtha via Steam Cracking(thermal) of is the cornerstone of the petro-chemical industry. Here,we will be studying how the process has been evolved over the time and the current prospects of it. Particularly, development of the catalyst and process for the “Catalytic steam naphtha cracking for olefin production&Double; will be studied with the practical experiments along with the theoretical literature survey
PROJECT-4: The project will be &Double;design of 3 phase reactor for hydroprocessing reaction
PROJECT-5: Operating the biogas digester for an economical & sustainable operation yet remains a challenging problem for the engineering community. There are multiple input and multiple output variables for an operational digester. Interestingly, these input-output variables interact. It means that change in one of the input variable value effect several of these output variable, which suggests strong interactions between variables. In this project, we intend to study more about this behavior and understand the process through the development of a realistic mathematical MIMO based model. Nature of this work is purely theoretical (modelling & simulation approach) starting with an intensive literature survey with a final objective of developing a realistic mathematical model.
PROJECT-6: Estimation of volumetric mass transfer coefficient by measuring DO levels as a function of time is air-water systems.
PROJECT-7: The petroleum industry is experiencing the paradigm shift from fuel to petrochemicals. Several agencies have predicted the fall in petroleum based fuel demand in coming years. This will lead to the availability of crude oil in surplus amount which can be efficiently used for the production of valuable petrochemicals. The production of petrochemicals is considered as an important route for the survival of petroleum industries in the coming time. Moreover, advancement in the field of e-vehicle is reinforcing the production of petrochemicals from fossil feedstock. Considering the demand for petrochemicals, research work related to its production is gaining lots of attention. Amongst various chemicals obtained from petroleum based feeds, aromatics are of paramount importance owing to its utility as a precursor for various chemicals, as an octane buster, as a solvent and so forth. The rising aromatics demand is appealing for an efficient catalytic route for direct conversion of crude oil to aromatics. The direct conversion of crude oil to aromatics is expected to improve process economics as well as production capacity. Currently, most of the petrochemicals are being produced from petroleum naphtha obtained during refining process. Nevertheless, an efficient catalytic route is desirable for the direct conversion of crude oil to aromatics considering its estimated surplus availability. The current project deals with development of catalytic process for the production of aromatics from crude derived mixed hydrocarbon feed. The direct route for conversion of crude to aromatics is expected to improve process economics as well as production capacity. An efficient catalytic route with higher production capacity is required to convert huge amount of estimated surplus crude oil and to meet the ever increasing demand for petrochemicals. Successful completion of the project will significantly affect the aromatics production process, cost of production and its utility in several fields. We are looking for the student who is willing to work on the above mentioned project. Project work includes literature, catalyst development and catalyst evaluation using fixed bed reactor.
PROJECT-8: The proposed project work addresses the catalytic co-processing of bio-derived glycerol and methanol for the production of high octane toluene and xylene. The methanol co-processing not only increases the conversion of glycerol and catalyst stability but it also increases the yield of alkylated benzene (TX). Since formation of aromatics depends upon the acidity and micro-pore channels of HZSM-5, a special emphasis has been given to modify such properties. The main objective of present work is to develop a modified HZSM-5 solid acid catalyst to achieve more than any published yield of TX (&tg;50 wt. %) from co-processing of glycerol and methanol. This process opens a new door for the production of renewable TX from bio-derived glycerol. Another advantage of this process is not only decreases the expenditure of TX imports in India but also lowers the production costs of bio-diesel.
PROJECT-9: We want to carry out the energy demand and supply evaluation of sugar and paper mills. We are in process of discussion with industry. Thus proposed project will include mathematical model development of major unit operations ( milti effect evaporator, crystalizatizer, and digester ) using matlab and open source process simulation software. There is also need to compile the literature on previous studies carried out for energy conservation in paper mill and sugar industries. A case study need to develop on either sugar or paper industry for energy reduction using pinch analysis.

Traditionally, saving & investment products from FD/RDs to mutual funds and stocks, have been sold &Double;product-first&Double; without sufficient consideration to user needs & aspirations. Jupiter is seeking to re-imagine the experience, building it &Double;customer-first&Double; by aligning it closely to the user&apos;s goals, and then help achieve them by doing the heavy-lifting on their behalf (be the Jarvis to Iron man!)

Project Domain Big data, ML, Anomaly detection Discipline Specialization CS, MSc Mathematics + CS Skill set requirement Probability & Statistics, Knowledge about Big Data Systems, Coding in Scala/Java
PROJECT-6: Brief Description Different kinds of data sit in various databases which are then queried by data analysts and data scientists to create some more complex and derivative data in the data lake. If any other user wants to use that data, he/she&apos;ll either go through different datasets to map which columns are coming from which dataset or just email a data engineer. To avoid this scenario, we want to create a data lineage solution that maps out the journey of a dataset - how it&apos;s being used in other derivative datasets. This solution will also offer auto discovery so that all the intermediate data that is produced by different data pipelines is populated the lineage graph.

The current NIMBUS quota management will not be sufficient to distribute NIMBUS resources fairly to teams. We need a service which keep track of the resources, and do the admission control as per the administrator’s settings for a team or a particular user. Administrator can take decision as per the current VMC delivery priority and set quota to groups. Users will be restricted if they are going beyond quota setting, this will reduce the failures and keep system always healthy and reliable. Usage Statistics: Usage statistics will help administrator to keep track of team’s usage and adjust resource allocation. This will help administrator to estimate of NIMBUS resources Individual users can get to know their current and past usage statistics to recommend administrator for quota adjustments. Estimates for deployment will make users more confident to get a SDDC deployed on the NIMBUS VMC platform. Diagnostics This will be one stop interface to run diagnostics for a SDDC to know any anomalies. This will reduce the triaging time for any of subject matter experts. Diagnostics will be intelligent to run on any of the SDDC on VMC NIMBUS 2.o to give a initial glance of problems. Sharing Users can share SDDC for a specific build or configuration e.g MultiAZ with a build, a upgraded SDDC etc. System will search for alive SDDC with a specific configuration search criteria and can request the SDDC owner. Owner should able to share the SDDC in one click to a user. This will reduce the time for users in search of seeing a configuration or do a non-destructive operation. Health monitoring: This will give everyone a one stop interface which aggregates different source of health information of systems and give users a confidence. This will reduce the effort of administrator to reach out to users for any infrastructure issues, this will be a self-service. Administrator can even put alerts on the console for general purpose. Users can subscribe/un-subscribe for any specific alerts like usage statistics, current estimation etc periodically. Runbooks and How-to Give a search with keywords to get a specific documents on a runbook or how-to. This will search a specific confluence namespace to get the pinpointed details. • Identify domain area and various sub areas of the Project: Domain – Cloud Platform o System Virtualization o SaaS Health monitoring o AWS services o Springboot Project - 3 (a) Project description in terms of broad phases: The overall project is VMC i.e VMWare on AWS cloud. VMC is a cloud platform organization within VMWare. VMC opens up VMWare customers to run their applications on the AWS cloud with the tools and software that are very familiar with. VMC is a very recent initiative within VMWare (2 year old) and operating as a startup driving the CEO vision of providing VMWare offering on “any cloud”. Many large enterprises around the world (Freddie Mac, Vanguard, etc) are customers of the offering. More details are available at https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws (b) Identify domain area and various sub areas of the Project: a. Opportunity is with the Developer Productivity team of the VMC. This is a core engineering team within VMC. The team is solely responsible for architecture, design and implementation of the scalable developer productivity solutions. The team enables the entire VMC service engineering teams to build, test, deploy and manage their applications. b. The team leverages the latest technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, ConcourseCI, GitOps, Terraform, AWS Lambda and other best of breed tools to build their software. Project - 4 Virtual Cluster Memory This project is all about realizing disaggregated memory support in our ESX kernel. This would involve development of special purpose memory management algorithms for managing the virtual memory management and the swap-sub-systems in ESX kernel.
